Tutorial: Basket Catch Game (MakeCode Arcade)

This is a beginner-friendly MakeCode Arcade project built with Python.
The player controls a basket and tries to catch falling apples.
It‚Äôs designed as a tutorial to teach two core programming concepts:
‚úÖ Conditions ‚Äì making decisions with if statements
‚úÖ Collisions ‚Äì detecting when two sprites touch

üéÆ How to Play
Move the basket left and right with the arrow keys (or joystick).
Apples fall from the top of the screen.
Catch an apple ‚Üí your score increases.
Miss an apple ‚Üí it resets and falls again.

Learning Goals
This project helps beginners understand:
1. Conditions
if apple.y > 120:
    apple.set_position(randint(0, 160), 0)
This condition checks if the apple has fallen past the bottom of the screen.
If true, the apple resets to the top.
2. Collisions
sprites.on_overlap(SpriteKind.player, SpriteKind.food, on_overlap)
This detects when the basket and apple collide.
When they overlap, the player scores a point.
